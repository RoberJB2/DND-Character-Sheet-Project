    README FOR JACKSON
///////////////////////////

// I Robert J., N. Arango, and Ellie R. all worked on this project
// A better compilation and description of this project exists on N. Arango's profile here:
// https://github.com/NicholasArango

// To run this program you're going to need the FasterXML, jackson-core download so that certain imports and portions of code run properly. 
// This is how the program saves and loads files
// https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-core/2.20.0, here is the URL for the download
//   1. Go to the URL
//   2. Click on the jar file and download
//   3. If you're using NetBeans you must put this in your library in order for it to run
//   4. If you're on VS Code or something else, go to the documentation
//
// We used Ant and JDK 17 or 21, I believe either work

Apache NetBeans/NetBeans:
  1. At the top, Click on Tools
  2. Then Libraries
  3. New Library
  4. Add Jar/Folder
  5. Create the name
  6. Add your files there
